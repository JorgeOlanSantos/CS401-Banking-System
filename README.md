## Project Summary

### Requirements
- There should be a banking system as well as an ATM system.
- Bank employees and customers must be able to log in with their account ID and password.
- Bank customers should be able to perform basic bank functions (i.e deposit, withdraw, and transfers).
- Bank employees should be able to create accounts and delete accounts.
- A GUI should be provided so that actions can be performed.

### Special Challenges
- First time implementing we tried to use Vectors, but we ended up moving to ArrayList because it was more practical and easier to implement
- We wanted to create two clients, a bank teller client and a ATM client. We were getting difficulties having both clients communicate with the server.
- We did not have enough time to fully integrate the GUI
- Hard to understand how classes work without visual aid
- The UML diagrams required multiple revisions
- Communicating ideas can be difficult
- Had to implement a new class topic soon after learning about it
- Essential keywords were forgotten at times (public, package)
